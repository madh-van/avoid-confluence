#+title: Avoid confluence
#+date: 2021-01-06

* Problem

 1) Are you tired of using the confluence web page regularly via the
    browser ?
 2) Are you suffering from an outdated confluence page; constantly
    having to update the pages manually ?
 3) Is your documentation not inline with the development changes ?

 A problem indeed.

* Solution

  Automate this process with ~ac~ (aka avoid confluence).

*  Getting started
  
  Copy the contents of  ~examples/~ to your notes dir and follow the
  naming conventions (avoid space)
#+begin_example
  20210209_103843--research-nn--notes-on-neural-network.org
  <<UID>>--<<TAG>>--<<TITLE>>
#+end_example
  
  + Setup for the notes dir

  Implicit assumptions; both =Guix=, and =Direnv= in installed globally.

   #+begin_example
# allow autoload of environment
direnv allow

# autoupdate to the latest commit of the project
pre-commit autoupdate

# to run test the project
pre-commit try-repo https://gitlab.com/madh-van/avoid-confluence  ac -v

# install hook to git by calling
pre-commit install

#+end_example

  I personaly like to take notes in markup language like =org= in emacs
  and Avoid confluence (ac) to keeps my documentaion up today.

* Dependencies

 The following dependencies are used for this project.

 1) =atlassian-python-api= to upload notes via its python api
 2) =pandoc= vai =pypandoc= (python interface) for converting the notes to
    confluence markdown. (also called as 'jira')
 3) =precommit= to automate the selection process of uploading modified notes.
